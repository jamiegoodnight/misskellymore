After gradating Uni with an undergrad in business, I became interested in the tech industry while working with startups overseas and in San Francisco. I knew that in order for me to contribute the utmost value, I would need to learn software development and computer science to help companies further succeed in their mission. I began the self-taught route a little over 2 years ago, and then enrolled in an immersive program where I learned how to work in cross functional teams, as well as lead them, while delivering results to project stakeholders.

Since embarking in the field I have gained recognition as top "Women in Tech" writer from Medium under the JavaScript in Plain English publication, led successful project deployments in cross functional teams, and continue to learn and grow as a developer.

In my spare time I enjoy loving and taking care of my senior dog, Jelly, advancing my skills, and reading wisdom books, The Four Agreements being my favorite.

Skills: JavaScript, React, React Native, Redux, Python, Node.js, SQL, Testing
